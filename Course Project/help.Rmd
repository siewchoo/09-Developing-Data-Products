<H4>Using the App</H4>

The dataset used is a compilation of the percentage of Singapore primary school leavers scoring A* to C for standard Mathematics by the different ethnic groups across the observed years.

In essence, this application is a visualization tool for this data. You will need to select
- for which year to display (individual year between 1997 to 2013 **or** All years)
- the ethnic group option (Malay, Chinese, Indian, Others, Overall).

By default, you will be presented the resultant plot under the <code>Plot</code> tab. To look at the associated table entries, simply click on the <code>Table</code> tab.

Should you have selected to plot for 'All years', a line chart will be shown. But if you have opted to display for an individual year, a histogram will be shown instead. This is true regardless of your choice for the ethnic option and is done to facilitate ease of understanding.
