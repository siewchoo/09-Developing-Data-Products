**Project Information**
- [Application](https://siewchoo.shinyapps.io/Developing_Data_Products_Course_Project) enables users to visualize data with plots or tables by selecting the relevant 
  - ethnic group option (Malay, Chinese, Indian, Others, Overall)
  - year options (1997 to 2013 *or* All years).
- Plot may be a line chart (plotting all years) or histograms (plotting individual year), regardless of ethnic option.
- Dataset can be found at the [data.gov.sg portal](http://data.gov.sg/).
